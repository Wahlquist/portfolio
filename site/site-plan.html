        [hi , im Sam Wahlquist and im studing computer science at Brigham Young Univesity Idaho. 
        I’m studding so that i can learn all there is about computers and how to use them to complete different tasks in industry. Im also doing a minor in physics because thats always interested me and i really hope that a science background will help me to be more capable to work. I hail from King George,  Virginia originally and i live in idaho now. Im making this website to explain a little about me for employers and to have a place to extract information to write a resume. Im looking for a job where i can help accomplish a goal as a team and have fun while doing it. And i’m hoping to do something along the lines of aerospace or helping code something to help in a physical problem. So this has mostly information about me.

        [Resume section
        This is where im putting all of my experience even though it not be much i hope to be able to add to each of these categories in the future to really have a packed resume.
        
        
        Class projects
        I’ve made a website [hopefully by the end of this assignment that’ll be true]
        
        Im working on a project to get an arduino to intirpit morse code and translate it onto a little screen in readable characters
        
        Job experiences 
        My first job was at dominos pizza. Where i first leaned how to work for a company and there i developed skills for working under a lot of pressure and how to work with a team [it felt like a few coworkers were my brothers]
        
        Then i got a job at a fast food/gas station called sheetz. Where i better learned how to work fast and to priorty
        
        Then i went a two year lds mission to mexico where we went two by two talking to people trying to help them be a little more happier and there i learned how to cooperate with a companion because we had to live 24/7 with a different person who would rotate ever so often.
        
        I helped my sister get her driver's licence which kinda felt like a job
        
        Society projects
        Ive been involved in a few societies here at college including:

        The high altitude research team. Where we send a ballon with equipped with different sensors in order to learn more about the atmosphere. 

        Im part of the ham radio club. I joined in order to get my technicians license to help in the high altitude research team to help track the balloon.

        Part of IEEE and im trying to help on the mind control wheel chair project but its a little advance for me so im mainly just learning.

      <p>
        [Some other bonus things/ skills i have are i picked up crochet and embroidery in mexico. And im kind of an expert at making little whales. I like camping and archery iback home in virginia id always go to the woods to climb a tree or whack a sibling with a stick. I also am quite proficient with the recorder. I did band for years as a percussionist and did theater as well. And while in theater i helped build sets. Im also fluent in spanish from living there for two years. Ive got experience in wood working and in most outdoorsy type activities because i grew up around a bunch of trees. I dont know if you relized by now but im really pushing this word count, and im just missing nine words left but now i hit them.
