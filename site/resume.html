        <h2>--------------------------Society projects--------------------------</h2>
        <p>Ive been involved in a few societies here at college including:

            The high altitude research team. Where we send a ballon with equipped with different sensors in order to learn more about the atmosphere.

        <h2>--------------------------Job experiences --------------------------</h2>
        <p>My first job was at dominos pizza. Where i first leaned how to work for a company and there i developed skills for working under a lot of pressure and how to work with a team [it felt like a few coworkers were my brothers]

            Then i got a job at a fast food/gas station called sheetz. Where i better learned how to work fast and to priorty
            
            Then i went a two year lds mission to mexico where we went two by two talking to people trying to help them be a little more happier and there i learned how to cooperate with a companion because we had to live 24/7 with a different person who would rotate ever so often.
            
            I helped my sister get her driver's licence which kinda felt like a job
